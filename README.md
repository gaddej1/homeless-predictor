# Homeless Predictor

Homeless Predictor is a website that predicts when the user would become homeless based on their monthly necessary expenses and savings and displays the homeless shelters in their county, which the site encourages the user to donate to or volunteer at.

Homeless Predictor has two use cases: calculate how long before homeless and find homeless shelters in a county in New Jersey. The use case descriptions for these can be found [here](docs/UseCaseDescriptions.pdf).

The UML Diagrams can be found [here](docs/UMLDiagrams.pdf).
